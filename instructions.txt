Keet Code Challenge - Data Engineer

Given:

- Create a new database (SQL RDS e.g. postgresl, sqlite) DONE
- Import the "users" CSV file into a new database table called “users”. DEON
- Create a new table named "daily_user_counts". DOEN
   The new table should have 5 columns, year, month, day, observed, count). DONE

Next: 
- Create a Python3 script that:
  - Reads "users" table into a pandas dataframe. DONE
  - Counts the number of users by day.    Done
  - Calculates the number of users expected to signup 1 day into the future. 
    Note a simple mean/average is sufficient for communicating an expected value.       
  - Append the new record with the expected count to the dataframe.    
  - Load/Insert the results of your calculations (the dataframe) into the 
    "daily_user_counts" table.

Finally:  
  - Create a `Readme` explaining how to run your solution 
  - Include any notes regarding how you might improve your solution  
  - Publish your solution to Github
  - Email a link to your repo.
